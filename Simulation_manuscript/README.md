These are the functions, scripts, demo, and data for FLiSimBA: Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications.

Details of the folders:
Functions: Functions used in the pipeline.
          GenPop512_FLIM_v2: generation of double exponential decay population;
          FlIMsim512_v2: sampling a number of photons from the exponential decay population and convolving with an instrument response function (IRF);
          AutoFluo_sim_v2: sampling of photons based on an empirically determined photon distribution of brain tissue without any fluorescent sensor expression; this function could be used for simulation of empirically determined autofluorescence and background;
          GenPop512_exp1_v2: generation of single exponential decay population.

Data: Data are arranged in the order of figures corresponding to those in our manuscript.

Scripts: scripts for simulation and analyses are arranged in the order of the corresponding figures in the manuscript.

Simulation_demo: This folder includes the script with detailed annotation and instructions, as well as the data needed to run FLiSimBA. Please read the 'Demo_Instruction.md' file for more instruction.
